# Overview: Risk Reporting and Recommendations with NIST CSF Lab
## Objectives
- Examine a case of an organization with information and technology assets.
- Demonstrate analytical thinking by classifying "crown jewel assets" and using different models and methods (NIST CSF, STRIDE) to describe different kinds of cyber risk.
- Use business context and other variables to determine constraints that forces tradeoffs and how to best approach risk management.

## Components of the project deliverable
- Risk briefing that translates cyber risk into business risk. 2-3 pages written to the CEO and CIO to influence a real business decision.
- Risk register and matrix to track different risks with priority scores.
- NIST CSF control map to determine what is needed vs. what is missing
- Options/alternatives for controls, tracking cost-benefit and tradeoffs.
- Consolidated one year plan for implementing controls. Demonstrate why decisions were made.
### Using NIST CSF 2.0 for analysis
| Function | Thinking |
| -------- | -------- |
| Govern   | Who owns risk? What policies exist? How are decisions made? |
| Identify | What assets matter? What threats exist? What would hurt the business the most? |
| Protect  | What controls reduce the most risk per dollar? |
| Detect   | How would the company know something bad is happening? |
| Respond  | Who does what when it goes wrong? |
| Recover  | How fast can they restore trust and service? |
