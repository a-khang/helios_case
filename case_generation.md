______

# Prompt

## Objective
Generate a realistic, fictional case study that can be used to analyze cyber risk and security decision making.

The case must support the following learning and portfolio goals:

- Examine an organization with meaningful information and technology assets.
- Demonstrate analytical thinking by identifying crown jewel assets.
- Enable the use of multiple risk and threat modeling methods, including:
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
  - STRIDE threat modeling
- Highlight how business context, regulatory pressure, and resource constraints force tradeoffs in risk management.
- Support analysis of different risk treatment strategies:
  - Mitigate
  - Transfer
  - Accept
  - Avoid

## Output Requirements
Produce a complete case study, ready for analysis.
Do not include solutions, controls, or recommendations.
Only describe the environment, risks, and constraints.
## Required Sections
Use the following structure and headings:

# Case Study  
**[Organization Name]**

## 1. Organizational Overview  
Describe the company, its industry, and its core mission.

## 2. Business Model and Objectives  
Explain how the organization makes money and what business outcomes depend on technology.

## 3. Organizational Structure and Resources  
Include approximate size, key functions, and security ownership.

## 4. Technology Environment  
Describe major systems, platforms, and integrations.

## 5. Information and Technology Assets  
List the major data and system assets handled by the organization.

## 6. Regulatory and Contractual Context  
Identify relevant compliance and customer expectations.

## 7. Business Pressures and Constraints  
Include budget limits, growth pressure, staffing limits, and operational tradeoffs.

## 8. Recent Risk Events  
Describe 2 to 3 realistic security or operational incidents that raise concern.

## 9. Management Problem Statement  
Explain what leadership is worried about and what decisions they need to make.

## 10. Analytical Framing  
State that the case will be analyzed using:
- NIST CSF (6 functions)
- STRIDE threat modeling

## Style Guidelines
- Professional, neutral, and realistic.
- No sensational language.
- Business and risk focused, not tool focused.
- Suitable for a resume or portfolio case study.

## Constraints
- The organization must have meaningful cyber risk exposure.
- Risk must be inherent to the business, not accidental.
- Security maturity should be moderate to low, not zero, not enterprise level.
- Financial and resource constraints must be credible.
